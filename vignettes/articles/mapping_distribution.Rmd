The main goal of the __expowo__ package is to retrieve information about the 
diversity and distribution of any plant family as publicly available at the 
taxonomically verified database 
[Plants of the World Online (POWO)](https://powo.science.kew.org).\

The package is intended to efficiently mine the content within the source HTML 
pages for any specific genus and family. It can return a comma-separated values 
(CSV) file with the number of accepted species and country-level distribution 
for any genus as well as the full checklist of accepted species in any genus or 
family, their authorship, original publication and global distribution.\

Here in this article, we show how to use the package's function `powoMap` 
for mapping the global distribution for any genus or family of flowering plants 
either at political country or botanical country level, following the 
[WGSRPD](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/wgsrpd/). The `powoMap` uses as input data the data frame-formatted resulting query from `powoSpecies` function. Then, `powoMap` can automatically create a single global distribution map for the entire family or multiple maps for each genus within input data. The map is colored according to the species richness using either [Viridis](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=viridis) or [RColorBrewer](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RColorBrewer) color palettes.

# Setup

__expowo__ is not on CRAN yet but you can install the latest development version 
from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DBOSlab/expowo")
```
```{r package load}
library(expowo)
```


# 1. Mining species distribution from POWO to use as input data in powoMap

To create global distribution maps using `powoMap` function, use first the package's associated `powoSpecies` function to get distribution information for the species of the target family or genus. It is also possible to adjust one of the arguments in `powoSpecies` function to extract data only from a genus or list of genera. 
See further details on how to do so in another article [here](https://dboslab.github.io/expowo/articles/mining_accepted_species.html).\

The example below shows how to mine the distribution for an specific genus of
Lecythidaceae. By defining a vector within the argument `genus`, here the function 
will search for all species and associated distribution data for just the genus
_Cariniana_. Note that we create an object called `mapspdist`, which is the
data frame-formatted input data to create the map. The output shown here (TABLE 1) 
is a simplified version, where we have removed some columns so as to focus on the display of just the distribution data.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(taxize)
fam <- "Lecythidaceae"
powocodes <- cbind(family = fam,
                   data.frame(taxize::get_pow(fam)))

mapspdist <- powoSpecies(powocodes$family, powocodes$uri,
                         genus = "Cariniana",
                         hybridspp = FALSE,
                         country = NULL,
                         verbose = TRUE,
                         save = TRUE,
                         dir = "results_powoSpecies/",
                         filename = "Lecythidaceae_Cariniana")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data("POWOcodes")
fam <- "Lecythidaceae"
powocodes <- data.frame(family = fam,
                        uri = POWOcodes$uri[POWOcodes$family %in% fam])

mapspdist <- powoSpecies(powocodes$family, powocodes$uri,
                         genus = "Cariniana",
                         hybridspp = FALSE,
                         country = NULL,
                         verbose = FALSE,
                         save = FALSE,
                         dir = "results_powoSpecies/",
                         filename = "Lecythidaceae_Cariniana")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::kable(mapspdist[-c(1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13)],
             align = 'c',
             caption = "TABLE 1. A general `powoSpecies` search for mining 
             distribution of the Lecythidaceae genus _Cariniana_.")
```


# 2. Creating global-scale map for one genus to show species richness at political country level

To generate a global distribution map for one genus that show species richness 
at political country level, use the previously generated `mapspdist` object as input
data of the `powoMap` function and set the `map_div` argument as "native_to_country".
This is the very column of the dataframe-formatted `mapspdist` object that is
associated to species distribution at political country.\

The example below shows how to create the global distribution map of _Cariniana_'s
species richness as colored by the `viridis` palette of the `Viridis` package. If 
you set up both the arguments `vir_color` and `bre_color` with any of the `Viridis`
and `RColorBrewer` color palettes, then two maps colored respectively by these 
color vectors will be automatically generated. Different file formats and resolutions
(e.g. JPG, PDF, PNG, TIFF) are also supported by setting the arguments `format` 
and `dpi`.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
powoMap(data = mapspdist,
        botctrs = NULL,
        map_div = "native_to_country",
        multigen = TRUE,
        verbose = FALSE,
        vir_color = "viridis",
        bre_color = NULL,
        leg_title = "SR",
        dpi = 600,
        dir = "results_powoMap/",
        filename = "global_richness_country_map",
        format = "jpg") 
```

\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.cap = "FIGURE 1. Global country map of species richness in _Cariniana_ genus colored with Viridis scale."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/global_richness_country_map_SR_Cariniana_viridis.png", dpi = 300)
```


# 3. Creating global-scale map for one genus to show species richness at botanical country level

To generate a global distribution map for one genus that show species richness 
at botanical country level, use the previously generated `mapspdist` object as input
data of the `powoMap` function and set the `map_div` argument as "native_to_botanical_countries".
This is the very column of the dataframe-formatted `mapspdist` object that is
associated to species distribution at botanical countries.\

The example below shows how to create the global distribution map of _Cariniana_'s
species richness as colored by the `viridis` palette of the `Viridis` package. If 
you set up both the arguments `vir_color` and `bre_color` with any of the `Viridis`
and `RColorBrewer` color palettes, then two maps colored respectively by these 
color vectors will be automatically generated. Different file formats and resolutions
(e.g. JPG, PDF, PNG, TIFF) are also supported by setting the arguments `format` 
and `dpi`.\


```{r, eval = FALSE}
data(botdivmap)
powoMap(data = mapspdist,
        botctrs = botdivmap,
        map_div = "native_to_botanical_countries",
        multigen = TRUE,
        verbose = FALSE,
        vir_color = "viridis",
        bre_color = NULL,
        leg_title = "SR",
        dpi = 600,
        dir = "results_powoMap/",
        filename = "global_richness_botcountry_map",
        format = "jpg")
```

\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.cap = "FIGURE 2. Global distribution map according to botanical subdivisions of _Cariniana_'s species colored with Viridis scale."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/global_richness_botcountry_map_SR_Cariniana_viridis.png", dpi = 300)
```


# 4. Creating global-scale map of species richness for an entire family

To generate a family-level global distribution map of species richness, use `powoSpecies`
function without any genus constraint so as to query a full species list of the 
entire family and the associated distribution data. Then, the resulting query object
should be used as input data of the `powoMap` function.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data("POWOcodes")
fam <- "Lecythidaceae"
powocodes <- data.frame(family = fam,
                        uri = POWOcodes$uri[POWOcodes$family %in% fam])

mapspdist <- powoSpecies(powocodes$family, powocodes$uri,
                         genus = NULL,
                         hybridspp = FALSE,
                         country = NULL,
                         verbose = FALSE,
                         save = FALSE,
                         dir = "results_powoSpecies/",
                         filename = "Lecythidaceae")
```

\
The example below uses the previously generated data frame-formatted `mapspdist`
object as input data to `powoMap` function, with the `map_div` argument set as 
"native_to_country", the `multigen` argument set as `FALSE`, the `vir_color` argument set as "viridis", and the `bre_color` argument set as "Spectral", 
so as to automatically produce two __global distribution maps__ of Lecythidaceae's species richness at __country level__, which are distinctly colored by `Viridis` and `RColorBrewer` color palettes.\

Note that if you had set here the `multigen` as `TRUE`, then the `powoMap` function would have produced individual distribution maps of species richness for every single genus within Lecythidaceae, all of which being stored in the desired directory at `dir` argument.\

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data(botdivmap)
powoMap(data = mapspdist,
        botctrs = botdivmap,
        map_div = "native_to_country",
        multigen = FALSE,
        verbose = FALSE,
        vir_color = "viridis",
        bre_color = "Spectral",
        leg_title = "SR",
        dpi = 600,
        dir = "results_powoMap/",
        filename = "global_richness_botcountry_map",
        format = "jpg")
```

\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.cap = "FIGURE 3. Global distribution map of all Lecythidaceae's species according to political countries and colored with Viridis scale."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/global_richness_country_map_SR_Lecythidaceae_viridis.png", dpi = 300)
```

\
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.cap = "FIGURE 4. Global distribution map of all Lecythidaceae's species according to political countries and colored with Spectral scale."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/global_richness_country_map_SR_Lecythidaceae_Spectral.png", dpi = 300)
```

\
\
The example below uses the previously generated data frame-formatted `mapspdist`
object as input data to `powoMap` function, with the `map_div` argument set as 
"native_to_botanical_countries", the `vir_color` argument set as "viridis", and 
the `bre_color` argument set as "Spectral", so as to automatically produce two 
__global distribution  maps__ of Lecythidaceae's species richness at __botanical countrylevel__, 
which are distinctly colored by `Viridis` and `RColorBrewer` color palettes.\

Note that if you had set here the `multigen` as `TRUE`, then the `powoMap` function
would have produced individual distribution maps of species richness for every single genus within Lecythidaceae, all of which being stored in the desired directory at `dir` argument.\

        multigen = FALSE,
        verbose = FALSE,
        vir_color = "viridis",

        dir = "results_powoMap/",
        filename = "global_richness_botcountry_map",
        format = "jpg")
